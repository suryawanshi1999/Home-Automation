1.Bulb ON/OFF (220v Control bulb)
2.Parking Garage OPEN/CLOSE (here I use Mini Servo)
3.Parking Light ON/OFF (here I use Led)
4.Temperature and Humidity sensor send its data to our smart android phone and also alert through message 
  if humidity or temperature exceed 
5.Motion Detector(PIR) also sent an alert message if someone comes in it's path

AIM :-With the help of GOOGLE ASSISANT controlling the home applicances through the android smart phone.
THINGS TO BE REQUIRED :-
1)DHT11 sensor
2)PIR sensor
3)NodeMCU microcontroller
4)Smart Phone
5)Bread Board and Jumper Wires
6)Holder,BULB(working on 220),Electrical Wire
7)Relay Channel (Here I use 2 channel)
8)Mini Servo Motor

Note>**** Things you have to do by our own:Intall arduino ide ,blynk and nodemcu library

1.We are able to control the Bulb ON/OFF through the Blynk app where we are made one button or we can use simple text phrases like       "Bulb On or Bulb Off" to our google assisant.
2.Similarly apply for Parking Garage OPEN/CLOSE (here I use Mini Servo).
3.We are getting the all the readings of humidity and temperature every second on our blynk app and also alert through message 
  if humidity or temperature exceed by its defined threshold value.
4.Simlarly for Motion Detector(PIR) also sent an alert message if someone comes in it's path (some intruder).
